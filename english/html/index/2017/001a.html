											<p>On August 31, 2013, dalian shipyard of China was confirmed to be building a new aircraft carrier, a large workshop with a section resembling the bow and a structure similar to the "liaoning". It is a medium-size conventional-powered aircraft carrier with ski-jump take-off and type 001A, which is also considered to be China's first truly home-made aircraft carrier.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On August 29, 2013, Yang yujun, spokesperson of the ministry of national defense, gave a clear answer to the question of China's home-made aircraft carrier at a regular press conference held by the press bureau of the ministry of national defense.Answer: "we have said for a long time that the liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, but it will never be the only one. In the future, we will take the development and construction of national defense into consideration in light of the needs of national defense and the building of the armed forces."Since the commissioning of China's first aircraft carrier, the liaoning, there has been much speculation about how many aircraft carriers China will build in the future.According to Russian media reports, according to existing information, China plans to build another conventionally powered aircraft carrier. With two aircraft carriers, China can gradually accumulate the necessary experience to use them and improve the potential of the Chinese navy for offshore attack.[6] the cost of China's first domestically built aircraft carrier could reach $3 billion.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On October 3, 2013, the head of a Chinese military enterprise revealed in an interview that China is ready to build its first domestically made aircraft carrier.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>At the end of 2013, dalian shipyard held a cutting ceremony of aircraft carrier steel plate, which means the construction of China's first domestically made aircraft carrier has started.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>The first aircraft carrier was built in sections on an indoor berth at dalian shipyard in 2014.To this end, dalian shipyard has been preparing for more than a decade, building 400 meters of indoor shipbuilding platform.In an effort to boost secrecy, the interior shipyard has set up a special security zone that is off-limits to outsiders, and the report said China's first domestically built aircraft carrier will be modified from the liaoning, hence the name type 001A.The bridge of type 001A aircraft carrier will be reduced, and radar and weapon systems will be adjusted.In the meantime, the living facilities on the carrier will be improved.The power system is powered by boilers made in Harbin and steam turbines, while the steel plates are made in baoshan, Shanghai, according to authoritative sources.The entire construction period of the aircraft carrier is expected to be 6 years, and the indoor construction of the hull will take about 2 years. Therefore, the shipyard will gather all sections of the hull into a 370-meter-long dock for closure as early as 2016, when the outside world can confirm by satellite and visual inspection.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On the morning of May 13, 2018, the type 001A aircraft carrier set sail from the dock of dalian shipyard to carry out sea test mission in relevant waters, mainly to test and verify the reliability and stability of power system and other equipment.[3] on May 18, the first sea test mission was completed, and the ship will soon return to dalian shipyard dock. This test mission, a number of equipment have been further tested, achieving the expected goal.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On April 23, 2017, the first china-made aircraft carrier was put on the uniform "formal suit" of the navy ship -- the standard navy gray, and the scaffolding is being removed gradually. It is expected to be launched soon.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On the morning of October 28, 2018, the type 001A aircraft carrier set off from dalian shipyard for its third sea trial in relevant waters</p>
