										<h3 class="list-left-content-title01">The test process</h3>
										<p>On July 4, 2016, a new j-20 test flight photo appeared online. In the new photo, the aircraft fuselage is no longer painted with the test flight number, and the logo of the PLA air force "bayi" has become gray.</p>
										<p>On August 25, 2016, the first mass-production j-20a was delivered to the army for trial.The j-20 is also the world's third fifth-generation fighter to deliver troops.</p>
										<p>In October 2016, military BBS appeared j-20 test flight photos, it can be seen that j-20 has been changed into two-color patches camouflage, is likely to be mass production type coating, and two j-20 test flight together, shows that the test flight work is coming to an end, and may have reached the training seed instructor pilot stage.</p>

										<h3 class="list-left-content-title02">What does j-20 mean?</h3>

										<div class="list-left-title02-content01 ">
											
											<p>It has the potential to accomplish air combat missions that the Chinese air force has been unable to accomplish before, and to enhance the overall strength of the Chinese air force.</p>

										<li>
											<p>The j-20 poses a threat to the us and its Allies' positioning in the asia-pacific region, comparable to China's aircraft carriers and a range of ballistic missiles.The significance of the fifth-generation j-20 fighter jet, which is in large-scale production and service, cannot be compared with the existing su-30 and su-35 series fighter jets of the PLA.For the United States, the j-20 adds to the challenges it could face in a conflict with the diaoyu islands in the Taiwan strait.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>The j-20 is now the most advanced fighter in the region, giving the Chinese air force a significant advantage over air forces from countries such as Japan, South Korea and India.Foreign media have compared the j-20 with fighter jets from other countries.Russia's sukhoi su-57 fighter jet has not been formally delivered into service due to several delays in development.The us f-35 fighter jet has also suffered from insufficient oxygen supply for many times, causing a large area of grounding and obstructed export.After reports that South Korea's kf-x stealth fighter had been forced to downsize to a four-and-a-half generation fighter jet because it could not master key technologies, news emerged that its partner, Indonesia, was planning to divest and had informed South Korea.Therefore, China's j-20 fighter jet has become the dominant fighter in the asia-pacific region.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>The j-20 is the fifth-generation fighter jet independently developed by China, and its development has achieved the four stated goals of building a new aircraft across generations, leading technological development, innovating research and development systems, and building an outstanding team.To build the new aircraft is to develop China's own next-generation stealth fighter according to the requirements of performance, technology and schedule.Leading technological development means achieving the goal of strengthening and prospering the military through independent innovation.The j-20 has made breakthroughs in situational awareness, information confrontation and cooperative operations, which is the only way for China's aviation industry to go from following to running and then to leading.Innovative research and development system refers to the construction of the most advanced aircraft research and development conditions and processes.Through the research and development of a large number of major heavy equipment, China has established a digital research and development system with Chinese characteristics.To build an excellent team means to temper an excellent research team through model development. These outstanding young people with patriotism and innovative spirit are the fresh troops for the future development of aviation industry.In the future, China will continue to advance the mechanization, informatization and intelligent development of fighter aircraft.</p>
