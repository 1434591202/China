After that, he transferred to the department of aeronautics, California institute of technology.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>He received a master's degree in aeronautical engineering and a doctorate in aeronautics and mathematics.From July 1938 to August 1955, qian xuesen was engaged in the research of aerodynamics, solid mechanics, rockets, missiles and other fields in the United States. Together with his tutor, he completed the research project of high-speed aerodynamics and established the "kamen qian xuesen" formula</p>
