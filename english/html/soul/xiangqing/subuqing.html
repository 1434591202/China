											<p>In September 1902 (the 28th year of guangxu reign of the qing dynasty), he was born in a mountain village in pingyang county, zhejiang province.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1911 (the third year of xuantong's reign in the qing dynasty), he was transferred to pingyang county first primary school more than 100 miles away.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1914 (in the third year of the republic of China), he was admitted to zhejiang provincial no. 10 middle school with excellent scores.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In July 1919, when he was just 17 years old, he went to Japan to study under the support of Mr. Hong, the principal of the middle school.After a month of Japanese tutoring, in February 1920, he participated in the entrance examination of Tokyo institute of technology and was admitted to the electrical engineering department of the school with excellent results.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>From 1920 to 1924 (1999-1993), he studied in the electrical engineering department of Tokyo technical college.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>(12 years of the republic of China in 1923) on September 1, there was a big earthquake in Tokyo, escape from disaster, clothes, books, notes do pay a torch, the second year in Tokyo in March higher industrial school, after graduation to enter oneself for an examination of Japan's famous university - department of mathematics, science college, northeast empire with two courses are full marks, ranked 90 students first, been accepted as the northeast imperial university math department of Chinese students.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1927 (the 16th year of the republic of China), he graduated from the department of mathematics, tohoku imperial university of Japan.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>At the beginning of 1928 (the 17th year of the republic of China), su buqing discovered four times (third-order) algebraic cones in the research of general surfaces.From then on, su buqing taught and studied at the same time.His research is mainly focused on affine differential geometry. He has published 41 papers in mathematical journals in Japan, the United States and Italy. Some people call him "the brilliant mathematical star rising over the eastern countries". </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Early in 1931 (20 years of the republic of China), and Mr Chen jiangong prior engagement: learn to zhejiang university together, after 20 years, the department of mathematics, zhejiang university make the world first-class level, fosters the talent, to the nation with the motherland and hometown deeply miss, finally returned to homeland after 12 years, to teach at zhejiang university department of mathematics, the condition of domestic teaching is very poor, wages are not sent out.With the help of the acting principal, he overcame difficulties and insisted on teaching and scientific research.He and Mr. Chen jiangong started a math discussion class and cultivated his students with strict requirements. Even during the Anti-Japanese War, the school moved west to guizhou and was forced to hold discussion classes for students in the cave.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1933 (2002), he was promoted to professor and chairman of the department of mathematics.He and professor Chen jiangong designed a set of modern teaching plan, pay attention to the basic training of mathematics, strict requirements for students, all courses have exercise classes, students have to go to the blackboard to calculate problems, do not calculate will not go on, known as "hang the blackboard"</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1937 (the 26th year of the republic of China), the department of mathematics of zhejiang university showed great strength in cultivating talents and began to recruit graduate students.Fang dezhi, his earliest student, has written research papers.In the second half of the year, su buqing studied in the air-raid shelter with literature when avoiding the invasion of Japanese aggressors.In mei tan, su buqing led several of his early students xiong quanzhi, zhang sucheng, bai zhengguo and others to stick to the research of projective differential geometry, and produced a series of important results.Many papers have been published in internationally influential journals, enjoying a high reputation in the world of geometry, and the school of differential geometry of zhejiang university led by su buqing has begun to form.Zhejiang university moved back to hangzhou.Su bu qing and Chen jian gong saw the need to connect the branches of mathematics, implemented the principle of teaching students according to their aptitude, and decided to let two outstanding students gu chaohao and zhang mingyong attend two discussion classes of "differential geometry" and "function theory", which was also a pioneering work at that time.Zhejiang university has also sent several top students to the mathematics research institute of the academia sinica in Shanghai, and several academically accomplished teachers have been sent abroad for further study as part of their efforts to expand international exchanges. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In November 1942 (the 31st year of the republic of China), Joseph Needham, professor of Cambridge university and head of the British scientific mission to China, visited the department of mathematics, school of science, zhejiang university.In the difficult years, I still lost no time in writing and organizing my research results. In the aspect of projective differential geometry, I used geometric composition to establish the basic theory of general projective curve. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>A theory of projective curves (1945) is a comprehensive report on the theory.Many important types of surface and conjugate networks are also studied, and rich geometric compositions are obtained.Especially in the aspect of closed Laplace sequence and composition (T4), the Laplace sequence with period of 4 is studied.In a special case, their diagonals are required to form a stratifiable pair.Such sequences are known internationally as su chains.An introduction to projective surfaces, published in 1946, is a summary of this aspect. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In October 1952, due to the adjustment of colleges and departments, he came to fudan university as professor and dean of the department of mathematics, and later served as dean, vice President and President of fudan university.He has served as a member of the CPPCC national committee and a deputy to the National People's Congress, as well as vice chairman of the seventh and eighth CPPCC national committee and vice chairman of the central committee of the democratic league.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1956, received the new China for the first time issued by the national natural science prize, award in the field of exhibition space differential geometry "K" research results, as well as rewards for many years in the "general metric space geometry" and "projective empty ask curve differential geometry", "K" exhibition space is a new study of 40 s.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1952, he was transferred to fudan university because of the adjustment of national colleges and universities.In the late 1950s, a series of novel and in-depth achievements were obtained by applying the conjugate network theory of outer differential form method in high dimensional projective space, which has been summarized into a monograph introduction to projective conjugate network.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1978, he served as the President of fudan university and made great contributions to teaching and scientific research while doing a lot of work to rectify the chaos in the education front.At the annual meeting of Shanghai mathematical society, he gave an assembly report entitled "theory and application of geometric shape design".He offered five lectures on differential geometry and presided over a discussion class on computational geometry.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In May 1980, Mr. Su presided over the first conference on applied mathematics in colleges and universities directly under the state education commission in Shanghai</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1989, under his guidance and care, the Shanghai association of industrial and applied mathematics was founded, and in 1990, the China association of industrial and applied mathematics (CSIAM) was founded, and he was hired as a consultant.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>He died in Shanghai at 16:45.13 on March 17, 2003 at the age of 101.</p>
