											<p>Deng jiaxian, the sixth sun of deng shiru, was born on June 25, 1924 in the ancestral home of deng's family, also known as the ancestral home of tiyan shanfang, huining county, anhui province.Deng yizhe, his father, was a professor of philosophy in Beijing medical university, Peking University, tsinghua university and other schools at that time.Deng jiaxian was the third of deng's four children. Eight months after deng jiaxian was born, he came to Peiping (Beijing) with his mother and two sisters.In 1936, he was admitted to the second grade of chongde middle school in beiping and entered the first grade (chongde middle school was closed in 1939 due to the Anti-Japanese War).In these three years, he has laid a good foundation in English, mathematics and physics.In chongde middle school, he became good friends with Yang zhenning, who was in his two classes.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Deng jiaxian lived in the age of national calamity. After the July 7th incident, the Japanese invaders entered Peiping.Before long, both Peking University and tsinghua university retreated to the south. Deng jiaxian's father suffered from lung disease and coughed up blood.In September 1939, deng jiaxin first entered Peiping zhicheng middle school to study in the second grade of high school.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In May 1940, in order to avoid persecution and finish his second year of high school, deng jiaxin reached kunming through Shanghai, Hong Kong and haiphong and laojie in Vietnam.From July to September, I studied in kunming cram school.In September, I entered jiangjin national no. 9 middle school in sichuan, and studied in the third grade of senior high school until graduation.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1941, deng first entered the national southwest united university -- southwest united university was founded during the extremely difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War. It was formed by the combination of tsinghua university, Peking University and nankai university.In spite of this, lianhe university has a very good academic atmosphere and has cultivated many outstanding talents. Deng jia was first trained by famous professors such as wang zhuxi and zheng huachi, and successfully completed the four-year university study with good results.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>When the war of resistance against Japan was won, he got his diploma and joined the "youth of the people", a peripheral organization of the Chinese communist party, in kunming.The following year, he returned to Peiping and was employed as a teaching assistant in the department of physics of Peking University.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Deng jia first taught at Peking University, he wanted to go to the United States, where the scientific level is higher, to learn more advanced knowledge, master more advanced knowledge, and serve the motherland.With the goal of building a new China by learning more skills, he passed the examination for graduate students in the United States in 1947 and entered the graduate school of purdue university in indiana in the following autumn. Due to his outstanding academic performance, he completed the credits in less than two years and passed the defense of his doctoral thesis.I got my PhD in just over a year!He was 26 years old and known as "Dr. Baby".</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>deng jiaxian first study abroad, life is very hard, began to have no scholarship, dare not eat according to the amount of food, can only eat according to money.For a while, he and hong chaosheng (later working at the institute of science's center for cryogenic physics) Shared a penthouse with an old American woman. Once they went to dinner, deng jia looked at two steaks and said to hong: "my piece is small, and your piece is big."Hong dynasty was born to his own share to the first standing.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Deng jiaxen's achievements were also brought into the attention of the us government. They planned to use better scientific research conditions and living conditions to keep him in the United States. His teachers also wanted him to stay in the United States and his school friends also asked him to stay, but deng jiaxen declined politely.In October 1950, he gave up his superior working conditions and living environment and returned to China with more than 200 experts and scholars.As soon as he arrived in Beijing, he joined professor wang ganchang and professor peng huanwu, his teachers, in establishing the institute of modern physics in China, opening up a new field in the field of nuclear physics in China.In 1956, deng jiaxian first joined the communist party of China.In the same year, together with he zuoxiu, xu jianming, yu min and others, he successively published "angular correlation of beta decay", "influence of radiation loss on free vibration in accelerators", "deformation of light atomic nuclei" and other papers in "journal of physics".Has made the pioneering work for the Chinese nuclear theory research.  </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>At that time, the central government decided to develop the atomic bomb on its own.On June 21, 1958, MAO zedong said at the enlargement meeting of the military commission: "the atomic bomb is such a big thing. Without it, people will say you don't count.All right, then, let's do a little, a little atomic bomb, a little hydrogen bomb, intercontinental missiles.I think it quite possible for ten years."Not long after that, China's first atomic reactor started up successfully!</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In the autumn of 1958, liu jie, vice minister of the second ministry of aviation, approached deng jiaxian and asked him if he would take part in the work, which must be strictly confidential.Deng jiaxin agreed without hesitation, home to his wife only said he "want to transfer work", can no longer take care of the home and children, communication is also difficult.His wife was supportive.Since then, deng jiaxen's name will disappear in the publication and external contact, his figure only appeared in the strict guards of the deep courtyard and desert gobi.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>When deng jia first learned that he would participate in the atomic bomb design work, excited sleepless, at the same time he felt the task is difficult, the burden is very heavy. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In August 1958, deng jia was first transferred to the newly built nuclear weapons research institute as the director of the theory department, responsible for leading the theoretical design of nuclear weapons, and then served as the deputy director of the institute, vice President and President of the ninth research and design institute of the ministry of nuclear industry, vice director of the science and technology committee of the ministry of nuclear industry, and vice director of the science and technology committee of the commission of science and technology of the commission of science and technology of the commission of science and technology of the commission of national defense.On October 16, nie rongzhen was appointed director of the national defense science and technology commission.More and more people with lofty ideals have gathered in Beijing to engage in this secret work in a nervous and orderly manner. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>From then on, deng jia first put all the efforts into the task;First of all, he took a group of just across the gate of college students, day and night pick up bricks and tiles to do the construction of test sites, just in the mass graves rolled out a asphalt road, in the pine forest beside the atomic bomb teaching model hall;In the absence of data and experimental conditions, deng jia first initiated the exploration of the atomic bomb theory.In order to be the "leader" of the atomic bomb design, he led everyone to study theory assiduously and conduct cutting-edge scientific research by his own power.Deng jia first recommended a package of books and materials, which he believes are a guide to explore the mystery of the theoretical design of the atomic bomb. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>As they are foreign documents, and only one, deng jiaxian had to organize everyone to read, one person read, everyone translated, overnight printing</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In order to solve the scientific mystery of the atomic bomb, scientists in the outskirts of Beijing are determined to give full play to their collective wisdom and develop China's "qi zheng bomb".At that time, due to the difficult conditions, comrades used the abacus to carry out extremely complicated atomic theoretical calculations.It would take more than a month to do it once, and more than a year to do it nine times.As the head of the theory department, deng jiaxian works with his class to guide young people in computing.Whenever he was overtired and his thinking stopped, he would say anxiously: "oh, one sun is not enough!</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>At a reception for the foreign affairs department in Beijing, he was asked what he had brought back."I brought my father some nylon socks that China can't make right now," he said. "I also brought my head full of nuclear knowledge."For the next eight years he worked on Chinese nuclear theory.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Deng jiaxian not only in the secret institute of science and technology in the painstaking efforts, but also often to the flying desert test site.He braved the heat and cold to spend eight years as a single man on the test site, leading 15 nuclear tests on site, and thus gaining a wealth of first-hand information.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1959, according to the decision of the central government, deng jiaxian planned to develop an atomic bomb within 8 years by "starting from scratch with your own hands". He chose three aspects of neutron physics, fluid mechanics and physical properties under high temperature and pressure as the main direction of developing China's first atomic bomb.Choosing the main direction is deng jiaxian's most important contribution to the theoretical design of China's atomic bomb.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, China was in serious difficulties.It was a time when China's atomic energy industry was stuck.On June 20, 1959, the central committee of the communist party of the Soviet union refused to provide mathematical models and relevant technical information of the atomic bomb.On August 23, the Soviet union unilaterally terminated the new defense technology agreement signed by the two countries, withdrawing all the experts, not even a single piece of paper was left, and said ironically: "without outside help, China could not develop an atomic bomb in 20 years.Just keep this scrap metal."</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>To remember the date when the contract was broken, the project code for China's first atomic bomb was named "May 96".</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>在这以后的五年时间里，科学家们和工程技术人员克服了资料少，设备差，时间短，环境恶劣等常人难以想象的困难，迎来了中国原子弹研制工作的决战阶段。 </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>The desolate landscape of northwest China.Even survival is hard.Can be seen when doing scientific research is very difficult, however "May 96" the soldiers rely on patriotism and revolutionary lofty ambition, simply put qinghai, xinjiang, the mysterious ancient lop nur, the ancient battlefield built into China's first nuclear weapons base. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On September 11, 1962, examined and approved by luo ruiqing, the ministry of the second ministry of civil aviation issued a report to the central government: "two-year plan", which proposed to try to explode China's first atomic bomb in 1964, at the latest in the first half of 1965.At this time, deng jiaxian and his colleagues came up with a theoretical design for the atomic bomb, which laid the foundation for China's nuclear weapons research.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In February 1963, he participated in and guided the simulated bombing test before the nuclear test in a place in north China.In September, under the command of marshal nie rongzhen, deng jiaxian and yu min led the original team of the theoretical department of the ninth institute to study atomic bomb, and undertook the theoretical design task of China's first hydrogen bomb.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>It was he who finally signed off on the design of China's first successful atomic bomb in October 1964.He also led researchers to sample the explosion site quickly after the test to confirm the effect.He also joined yu min and others into the research of hydrogen bomb.According to the "deng-yu plan", a hydrogen bomb was finally made and successfully tested two years and eight months after the atomic explosion.That compares with France in eight years and six months, the United States in seven years and three months and the Soviet union in six years and three months.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>China's ability to develop "two bombs and one star" in such a short time and on such a poor basis [23] (8 years in the former Soviet union, 6 years in the United States, 4 years in France, and 2 years and 8 months in China) is inconceivable to westerners.Yang zhenning asked deng jiaxian, who had not yet revealed the nature of his work, before returning to China to visit relatives.Is it true?"After asking zhou enlai for instructions, deng jia wrote to him and told him, "both the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb were developed by the Chinese themselves."Yang zhenning was so excited that he shed tears.It is precisely because of such a group of dedicated intellectuals that China has a strong national backbone.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1966, the "cultural revolution" broke out.After zhou enlai consulted MAO zedong, the central government decided that the bases and personnel of the state to develop nuclear weapons could not be affected, and they were in military control units, so deng jiaxin's unit and himself were not affected at the beginning of the "cultural revolution".It is under this protection that deng jiaxin and a group of scientists working on nuclear weapons continue to work hard and achieve many new achievements.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1971, when rebels attacked the compound, many of the scientists who had built great achievements were rounded up, and deng jixian, yu minhong, hu fang and others were rounded up at the base in qinghai and criticized.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Some rebels also demanded that scientists "hand over" key data on nuclear weapons research, which severely tested deng jiaxin in adversity.When he was criticized, deng jiaxin tried not to bring huge losses to China's nuclear weapons industry.He did not say a word against his will, and although he was in danger, he joined with other scientists in never disclosing any important scientific achievements.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>At this time, Yang zhenning flew to Shanghai from the United States via Paris and returned to the mainland for his first visit.He listed the list of people to meet in Beijing, the first person is deng jiaxian, premier zhou enlai instructed deng jiaxian to return to Beijing to meet, rescued deng jiaxian, also rescued a group of China's precious scientists;Following the instructions of premier zhou enlai, deng jiaxin wrote to Yang zhenning overnight: "all of China's atomic and hydrogen bombs were developed by the Chinese themselves, and no foreigners participated."This letter was sent to Shanghai by civil aviation flight and delivered to Yang zhenning at the farewell dinner on August 16, 1971.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1972, he became vice President of the ninth research institute of the ministry of nuclear industry.In 1979, he became President of the ninth research institute of the ministry of nuclear industry.That year, in an experiment, the body was affected by radiation, but still kept working.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1980, he was elected as a member of the Chinese academy of sciences.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1982, he won the first prize of national natural science.Elected as a member of the 12th CPC central committee</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1984, it was rated as a national expert with outstanding contributions.In that year, he directed China's second generation of new nuclear weapons test in the desert.Twenty years after the explosion of the first atomic bomb, deng jiaxin directed his last nuclear test in his life.After 20 years of climbing, the second generation boat has crossed the bridge."The next year, his cancer had spread beyond saving, he asked on National Day to see tiananmen square.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>He was hospitalized on July 30, 1985, for rectal cancer.At this time, his life came to an end. He went to the hospital and never came out.He lived for 363 days and underwent three operations.For 363 days, he was in constant pain. The pain-killing drug demerol increased from one injection per day to one injection per hour, causing massive hemolytic bleeding all over his body.At that time, they won the special prize of national science and technology progress for "breakthrough and weaponization of atomic bomb" and "breakthrough and weaponization of hydrogen bomb".</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In June 1986, deng jiaxin, chairman of the central military commission, signed an order appointing deng jiaxin as deputy director of the commission of science and technology of the commission of science, technology and industry for national defense.On July 16, the state council awarded him the national May Day labor medal.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On July 29, 1986, deng jiaxin died of massive bleeding due to terminal cancer.His last words were about working on sophisticated weapons and exhorting: "don't let us be left behind too far...Zhao ziyang, then premier of the state council, returned to Beijing to attend deng jiaxen's memorial service."Deng jiaxian is a model of our country's science and technology workers," he said at the memorial service. "he is the pride of our science and technology workers." </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Deng jiaxian's father-in-law, xu deheng, vice chairman of the CPPCC national committee, also remembered deng jiaxian at his big hiding spot: "I am deeply saddened by the death of jia xian."On the other side of the earth, professor Yang zhenning, a former friend thousands of miles away, also sent a telegram to professor xu luxi, deng jiaxen's wife.</p>
