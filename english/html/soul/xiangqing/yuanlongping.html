											<p>In the summer vacation of 1947, I won the first place of men's 100-meter freestyle in hankou competition when I was a freshman in high school.Won the second place of men's 100m freestyle in hubei province.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>From February 1948 to April 1949, he studied in the high school attached to nanjing central university (now the high school attached to nanjing normal university). </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>August 1949 to October 1950, in chongqing beibei xia ba xianghui college of agriculture study.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>1949.08 -- 1953.08, majored in crop science, department of agriculture, southwest agricultural university. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>1from November 1950 to July 1953, the school was adjusted and merged into the department of agriculture of the newly established southwest agricultural university in chongqing.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>1951年7月，袁隆平在西南农学院报名参加空军，体检、政审合格，后因在校大学生更需参加经济建设，而未入伍，继续留校学习。</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In August 1953, yuan longping graduated from the department of agriculture of southwest agricultural college (now southwest university).Obey the national unified distribution, to hunan province huaihua district anjiang agriculture school to teach.In the same year, he was assigned to teach in anjiang agricultural school in the remote and backward xuefeng mountain.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Aug. 1953-jan. 1971.teacher of anjiang agricultural school in hunan province.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In July 1960, he accidentally found a rice with special characteristics in the experimental field of the agricultural school.He used this rice plant for trial planting and found that its offspring had different properties.Since rice is self-pollinated and does not separate traits, he reasoned that it should be natural hybrid rice.He then artificially removed male and female rice flowers with the same core and gave pollen to another variety to try to produce hybrid varieties.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In the spring of 1961, he planted the seeds of the mutant strain in his pioneering field, and it turned out that the plant that stood out from the crowd, discovered in 1960, was "natural hybrid rice."He was a teacher in an jiang civil school at that time, but faced with severe famine at that time, he determined to defeat the threat of hunger with agricultural science and technology, and engaged in rice male sterility test.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On July 5, 1964, he found a "natural male sterile strain" in the experimental rice field, which was artificially pollinated and produced hundreds of seeds of first-generation male sterile strains.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In July 1965, yuan longping found 6 sterile strains in more than 14,000 rice ears ear by ear, and in the following two years of sowing, a total of 4 strains successfully reproduced for 1 ~ 2 generations.His research completely overturns the traditional classical theory of "asexual hybridization" by michulin and lysenko, and deduces that rice also has hybrid advantage.The yield of hybrid rice can be greatly increased by cultivating male sterile line, male sterile maintainer line and male sterile restorer line. </p>

										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On February 28, 1966, the first paper "male sterility of rice" was published in the bi-monthly bulletin of Chinese academy of sciences, vol. 17, no. 4.May, director of the state administration of science and technology commission nine innings Zhao Shi the comrade, learned that yuan longping published essay, after the rice male sterility, attaches great importance to, in the name of the bureau of science and technology commission and nine letter to science and technology commission of hunan province and an giang aggie, the support of the yuan longping rice male sterility research activities, pointed out that the study is of great significance, if successful, will make the rice yield significantly.[19] in June, from the beginning of the cultural revolution, yuan longping was impacted, and the male sterility test of rice was interrupted. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In April 1967, yuan longping drafted the "breeding plan for male infertile rice lines in anjiang agricultural school" and submitted it to the provincial and guizhou provincial science and technology commission.In June, yuan longping, li bihu and Yin huaqi formed the research group of rice male sterility in qianyang agricultural school (renamed anjiang agricultural school). </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>On April 30, 1968, yuan longping planted more than 700 rare sterile material seedlings in no. 7 field of middle ancient plate in anjiang agricultural school, covering an area of 133 square meters.On the evening of May 18, the middle plate 7 field of sterile material seedlings, were all pulled out destroyed, became a mystery.Yuan longping was heartbroken.The fourth day after the incident in a waste well in school to find the survival of 5 seedlings, continue to adhere to the test. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In the winter of 1969, yuan longping, li bihu, Yin huaqi and so on accelerated the reproduction of sterile materials in yuanjiang county, yunnan province.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In the summer of 1970, yuan longping introduced wild rice from yunnan and planned to hybridize it in jing county (anjiang agricultural school moved to jing county).In autumn, yuan longping led the scientific research team libihu and Yin huaqi to hainan, where nanjiang farm in ya county of hainan island was in good condition for three-season rice experiment, to conduct research experiments and investigate the distribution of wild rice to technicians and workers at the farm.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In the spring of 1971, hunan academy of agricultural sciences established the hybrid rice research collaboration group, and yuan longping institute of agricultural sciences worked on the hybrid rice research collaboration group.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1973, the cooperative group found the restorer line through test and delivery, and overcame the "three line" matching difficulty.In October, yuan longping published a paper titled "progress in breeding three lines by using" wild failure "at the rice scientific research conference held in suzhou, formally declaring that the" three lines "of indica hybrid rice in China have been matched.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1975, yuan longping conquered the "seed production" and explored and summarized the success of seed production technology.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1977, yuan longping published two important papers, "practice and theory of hybrid rice cultivation" and "key technologies of hybrid rice seed production and high yield".</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In September 2017, in 2017 countries live visit meeting new varieties and new technologies, yuan longping announced a weed out the new achievements of cadmium in rice: "recently we have a breakthrough in rice breeding technology, can put the parents of the gene containing cadmium or cadmium absorption 'broken', clean, parents seeds naturally clean.</p>
