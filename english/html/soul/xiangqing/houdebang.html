										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1913, tsinghua university published the list of the first batch of higher graduates, and 16 of them went to the United States for study. Hou was listed on the list, and was admitted to the department of chemical engineering, Massachusetts institute of technology in the United States.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Graduated in 1917, received a bachelor's degree, then entered the pratt college to study leather, the next year received a diploma of leather chemist.In 1918, he also participated in the research of tanning at the research institute of Columbia University, obtained the master's degree in 1919, obtained the doctor's degree in 1921, and worked as an engineer in wynn alkali company.Due to his excellent academic performance, hou debang was admitted as a member of sigmaxi scientific society and philambdaupsilon chemical society of America.Hou debang's doctoral dissertation "iron salt tanned leather" and "journal of American tanning chemists association" were specially serialized and published in full, which became one of the classic literatures widely cited in the leather industry up to now.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1921, hou debang accepted the invitation of fan xudong, general manager of yongli alkali production company, and left the United States to return to China.With the technology and market for alkali production closely monopolized by foreign companies, yong bought a brief copy of solway's method for a large sum of money.Hou debang is immersed in studying this brief data, lead broad worker long-term hard work, solved a series of technical problems, achieved success in 1926, normal production high quality soda ash.Since 1922, he has been elected as the director and executive director of China chemical industry association.Director of the Chinese society of chemical engineering;President of the Chinese chemical society;President of the Chinese society of chemical industry;Chairman of the preparatory committee of China chemical society.In 1923, he held the post of chief engineer and chief manufacturer.On June 29, 1926, yonglisheng produced more high quality alkali than bu neimen.In August of that year, wynn's red triangle soda ash was awarded the gold medal at the world's fair in Philadelphia.After the successful price war, yongli really broke the monopoly of yangye.Since 1927 in yongli chemical industrial company as chief engineer and tanggu alkali factory director.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Based on his own practice, he wrote manu-factureofsoda in English, which was published in New York in 1933 and had a profound impact on academia and industry.Exhibition "again in 1934, wynn company to a wing" chemical and fertilizer production, construction and decided to produce synthetic ammonia, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate zinc factory in nanjing, appointed Hou Debang factory director and technician (engineer) long, will be entirely responsible for the preparation.In January 1937, the heavy chemical joint enterprise was built. It was successfully tested and put into production, and its technology reached the international level at that time.It provides good experience in how quickly and cheaply factories can be built.This plant, together with yongli alkali plant, laid the foundation of China's basic chemical industry and cultivated a large number of chemical science and technology talents.On February 5, 1937, under the efforts of hou debang, ammonium sulfate was produced and nitric acid was put into production smoothly -- this marked that Chinese engineers and technicians could completely control the overall project of sulfuric acid plant, ammonia plant, ammonium sulfate plant and nitric acid plant."The July 7th incident", the Japanese invaders compelled to nanjing, gradually has three times to "factory security threat", "cooperation" management of nanjing zinc factory request.Hou debang and his colleagues refused to "cooperate", and at the same time, actively responded to the war of resistance, using factory facilities to produce ammonium nitrate explosives and mine shells and other materials to support the front line.This time, was also the nanjing zinc factory chief engineer</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1938, yongli company built yonglichuan xihua factory in wutong bridge, west sichuan. Fan xudong appointed hou debang as the factory director and chief engineer.Under very difficult conditions, hou debang led the staff to help themselves in production and maintain the livelihood of the company's staff.At the same time, he started to organize sichuan alkali factory.Because the conditions in sichuan are not suitable for the use of ammonia-alkali method, hou deban went to Germany for investigation in 1939 and prepared to buy the patent of cha-an law.Under the other side's condition of humiliating the country, hou debang suspended the negotiations and angrily studied a new alkali production method by himself.In 1940, fan xudong named it "hou alkali system".Later, he led a large number of scientific research and design personnel to work hard, and in 1941, he developed a new process of combining the process of alkali production and ammonia synthesis in one furnace to produce soda ash and ammonium chloride fertilizer.In 1943, the semi-industrial device was tested, but due to the war and political chaos, there was no condition for continued industrialization.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In August 1945, shortly after the Japanese invaders surrendered, fan xudong died. Hou debang succeeded him as general manager and led the work of yongli chemical industry co., LTD.He immediately organize restore wynn tanggu factory with nanjing zinc factory production.Zinc factory equipment of nitric acid in the war by the Japanese invaders shipped to Japan, after Hou Debang and lee candle dust repeated solemn representations to the relevant aspects, he jetted to Tokyo for the allied headquarters related aspects, such as argued, was back in 1948, and restore the nitric acid production, are still running.In 1947, hou debang was employed as the consultant chief engineer of tata company in India. He went to India five times to instruct and improve the equipment and technology of the alkali plant of the company, so as to make the plant run normally and produce high quality soda ash.Later, when prime minister Nehru visited China, he also spoke highly of the friendship between the two peoples.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>April 20, 1949, nanjing liberation, the old bourgeoisie and the upper intelligentsia quickly and fiercely divided.When hou fan xudong died, he fled to India at a loss.During the 5th visit to India, hou debang learned that the leaders of the central committee of the communist party of China are very concerned about the cause of wynn, and hope to discuss national affairs with him, which made him very excited.Later, he was elected as a member of the first national committee of the Chinese people's political consultative conference (CPPCC) and a member of the second, third and fourth standing committees.Deputies to the first, second and third sessions of the National People's Congress;He was successively appointed as a member of the central committee of finance and economics, technical adviser of the ministry of heavy industry and vice minister of chemical industry of the state council.Employed as a member of the department of technology and science, Chinese academy of sciences.In 1950, he was a member of the central committee of finance and economics, a technical adviser of the ministry of heavy industry, and elected vice chairman of the all-china federation of natural sciences.In 1952, he became general manager of yongli chemical industry co., LTD., a public-private joint venture. </p>

										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1957, in order to develop a small fertilizer industry, hou debang proposed to use carbonization to make ammonium bicarbonate.In the same year, he joined the communist party of China.He participated in many important decisions of the national chemical industry and scientific and technological undertakings and led many major scientific and technological activities in the chemical industry.Under his advice and guidance, supplementary tests and intermediate tests were carried out on the new combined alkali production process, which was industrialized in 1962 and became one of the main methods for producing soda ash and fertilizer in China.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In 1958, he served as vice minister of chemical industry and was elected vice President of China association for science and technology.Later, hou debang put forward the idea of a new process of making ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer from carbonized synthetic ammonia, and personally led the design, construction, test and improvement of the demonstration plant, which was successful in 1965.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>After 1972, hou debang became increasingly ill and moved inefficiently. He still asked for inspection to help solve technical problems, and invited scientific and technical personnel to have a meeting at home to discuss the perfection and development of xiaolian alkali technology, making painstaking efforts until the last rest of his life.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Mr. Hou's life was legendary and highly respected, but he was unable to work during the cultural revolution.Confused and frustrated, he died in Beijing on August 26, 1974 at the age of 84.</p>
